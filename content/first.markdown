Title: First Post

I've had several blogs over the years but I never really managed to consistently update one. The reason why I started this one is sort of stupid. I want to keep my streak on github, but I also want to spend time reading/learning computer graphics. However, I know that some days if I spend them reading I won't write any code, so the purpose of this blog is to make me actually learn something when I don't write code by forcing me to write about what I learned in order to keep the streak.

I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Regardless, it was also a chance to set up my github.io page. I'm using pelican because it was easier to install on arch than jekyll since I already had pip installed and didn't feel like figuring out rubygems.
