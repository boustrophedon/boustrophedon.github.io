I've been reading "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr aka "the OKR book". It's written in what I can only describe as a very business-school textbook style. The first half's chapters explain how to use OKRs, and the second half describes "applications and implications for the new world of work" which I would just describe as "other related stuff".

Reading the book has definitely sold me on the usefulness of OKRs, whereas before I was kind of ambivalent on them. I think this is because when I first encountered them as an intern at Google, they were only really half-explained - we were told what they were but not the why (or maybe we were and I just didn't pay attention!). Looking back, I definitely had better OKRs for my first internship than my second, which correlates with being more successful in my first internship than my second, though there were many reasons why my second internship was not successful.

I actually now think this book, or at least the summary at the end, should be required reading if you're going to use OKRs. Although the core idea is simple, the book expands on the idea and consequences: setting your goals ambitiously (stretch), focusing and narrowing down your goals to something achievable (focus and commit), how to align OKRs up and down the organization (align and connect), how to grade OKRs (track for accountability). 

What solidified the importance of the idea for me was the realization that using OKRs is just using test-driven development for project management. I haven't actually read a book on TDD (though I probably should), but I think that in the same way that TDD tells you that you are writing code that does the things you want, OKRs tell you whether you are achieving the goals you want. If you want to think about it in very specific terms, objectives are your tests, and key results are the code you write to satisfy the tests. In particular, *you don't do things that don't contribute to your objectives* in the same way you don't write code that doesn't turn a test from red to green.

There is more to it than just "tests and code", and if you wanted to extend the metaphor you could maybe make a connection between integration tests and aligning OKRs across teams and stuff, but I think the base comparison is enough to sell most developers to at least think about it more. And if the developer doesn't write tests, well, there's no saving them. (they'll figure it out eventually)

OKRs are not a panacea, however. Among the many things cautioned in the book, probably the most important are choosing the wrong objectives and choosing too many objectives. In fact, it wasn't poised this way, but the Youtube case study kind of highlights what happens if you choose the "wrong" objectives. The Youtube case study ranges over several people at various levels of leadership, but the thing that stuck out to me was the way that the objectives changed: at first it was views, then it was watch time, and then it was total watch time TODO fix this section. To me, the changing objectives seems to say that they haven't found the right objective. Sure, you can argue that the right objective can change over time.

There is also the problem that, although the various groups in the organization may have aligned their objectives, the objectives are not aligned with their users, both content creators and viewers. Later, in the section about ONE and Bono, John asks them "Who is the client? Do they have a seat at the table?" and in the case of Youtube, well, they claimed in their OKRs that they want to "delight users" but it didn't sound like their users had a seat at the table. In fact, the biggest complaint about Google is that there's no way to talk to them. Some teams do talk to their users (Fiber and Flutter being two that I personally know of), but others are big black boxes. You can argue for youtube the "users" are the advertisers and the "product" is the users, but TODO. Also in contrast twitch's objectives align with their streamers 

The last thought that I have on this book is that, although almost all the testimonials are from corporations and the language is heavily management-coded, the core principles are not specific to corporations. Nonprofits, open-source projects, and research teams could all benefit from having clear goals and enumerated, measurable subgoals to achieve the objectives. If you really wanted, you could use these ideas to work on a group project in a high school class.

Okay one more thing: I was having a hard time getting how you effectively communicate your OKRs across teams to align objectives. If everything cascades down directly from the top, everything is aligned, but as is explained in the book, this prevents ideas and problems from being transmitted upwards, and can make it difficult to effect rapid change.

Near the end of the book in one of the case studies, it mentions how one company eschews the use of green yellow red grades, and instead has just green and red. They have a monthly review, and greens are mostly ignored. It's a bit unclear how they actually make and grade the OKRs (usually grades are given retroactively, so perhaps their objectives are eg. quarterly and the KRs evolve monthly? and this takes place after grading the previous month's KRs). The owners of the "red" OKRs then "sell" i.e. present why their OKR is at risk, and then everyone votes on which are the most important, and people volunteer to "buy" other teams' reds. This seems like a very effective way to communicate and align goals across different parts of an organization and I'm a bit surprised it's somewhat buried towards the end. The whole "buying"/"selling" thing is a bit superfluous but the idea seems great.

TODOS: review youtube sections, reorganize into sections (overview, topic, conclusion, etc)
