Title: Processes are important
Status: draft

Processes are important.

- having a list of tasks, reviewing them. this has a name?
- the act of writing things down is just as important as the thing itself. it legitimizes it. this is part of what okrs do.
- having a process explicitly allows you to then talk about the process itself, and improve it.
- okrs
- sigma and kaizen or whatever those are?
