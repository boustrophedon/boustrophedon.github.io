          <p>I haven't used this blog in about 3 years but I finally graduated and I'm spending the summer working on stuff I want to work on. Hopefully I'm going to use this to talk about the stuff I've been working on.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://getpelican.com/">pelican</a> theme is new (you can find it <a href="https://github.com/boustrophedon/boustrophedon.github.io/blob/master/pelican/minimalXY0">here</a> and is a minimalization of the <a href="https://github.com/petrnohejl/MinimalXY">MinimalXY theme</a>, which is itself based off the minimalX theme. I just removed all the extra stuff like analytics, disqus, and some fonts that were only being used for like 3 icons. The name of the blog is just the two longest words in my <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code>.</p>
<p>Overall there are a few things that I want to do this summer: One, I want to write a volumetric path tracer using Vulkan compute. Two, I want to improve my resume for when I apply for jobs in the Fall. Three, I want to improve my applied statistics and do some sort of data science project. They're all kind of related in that the renderer and data science stuff will improve my resume, but I feel like I want to do the renderer because I really want to, whereas the other stuff is more for "resume-padding" (which is in quotes because I still want to do them, but maybe I would prioritize other things if I weren't looking for a job). My "project ideas" category in my todo list has 21 entries.</p>
<p>The first post, which might also be going up today, is going to be about OKRs and the book "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr. I may or may not write or include in that post my own OKRs for this summer for myself.</p>
