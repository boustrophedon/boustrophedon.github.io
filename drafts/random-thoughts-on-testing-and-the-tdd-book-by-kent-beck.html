<h1>Mocks</h1>
<p>This section is mostly a response or agreement with <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">this blog post </a> by Martin Fowler.</p>
<h2>Outside-in vs bottom-up</h2>
<p>The difference between these two is not the end result: you can end up with working, tested code either way like this. The difference is in how easy it is for the programmer to do so. With bottom-up, writing unit tests firsts and very few mocks, you always have working code, and can easily, for example, revert to the previous commit and be in a working state. If you write the acceptance/system/etc tests first, you will not have working code for a while and instead continue to pile up failing tests, or, if you use mocks, you simply build a tower of mocks that do nothing. </p>

<h1>type systems</h1>
<p>There's lots of talk about the relationship between strong type systems and strong testing procedures (see <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/05/01/TypeWars.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/functional-tdd-a-clash-of-cultures/472392329460303">here</a>, and <a href="">here</a> for some examples)</p>
<p>as with the difference between writing unit tests first vs writing system tests first (outside-in vs bottom-up) the difference is not in the end result but the view from a programmer's perspective.</p>
<p>the power of strong type systems lies in the ability to reason locally about the code. If you have a function in rust, you can always know what type a variable is, and what operations it can perform. Certainly with dynamic languages you can do some level of static analysis and have IDE plugins that let you see what a variable <em>might</em> be, but in highly dynamic languages you never really know without actually executing the program.</p>

<h1>Mutation testing and property testing</h1>
<p>mutation testing: fix test inputs, change output
property testing: change test input, fix "output"</p>
<p>in the red-green-refactor cycle, property testing adds confidence to the "green" part - that your code is working
mutation testing adds confidence to the "red" part - that your tests are working! </p>
