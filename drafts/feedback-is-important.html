<p>Recent google chrome store problems: https://medium.com/@BeeLineReader/google-yanked-my-chrome-extension-this-sunday-d9c481e285cb, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17449903</p>
<p>It's very likely that google simply had no feedback mechanism to detect that these emails and automated systems were not working properly. The code may have had tests, but there was probably no system making sure that the 7-day period was actually seven days, and not "at the end of the current week which is also a 7 day period" which is likely what happened. </p>
<p>semi-related that I saw at the same time about a/b testing: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17443485 - A/B testing is often useless because the feedback is poor quality</p>
<p>related: customer development methodology</p>
<p>feedback is the core driver of neural net-based machine learning i.e. gradient descent. also feedback loops in terms of valve vacnet data and andrew ng similar cycle in some talk i have saved</p>
