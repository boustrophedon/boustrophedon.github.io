                        <p>Yesterday, July 1st, I went to the IGDA NJ arcade demo meetup thing instead of studying for my differential equations final on the 2nd. didn't do too well, oops. However, there were cool people there and there were some surprisingly cool games. More importantly, I talked to a few people who were at the very least interested in coming to talk to COGS. Everyone there was indie so I didn't even mention the word "sponsorship" and I wouldn't ask anyone there for money for COGS, but meeting people is always helpful because you can't predict who knows who.</p>
<p>It's a bit unfortunate they went to a bar afterwards because Richard and I (I went with him and he drove) were pretty hungry and it would have been cool to hang out with the people there some more. It seems like it's a monthly-ish thing, and I got into the NYC IGDA group recently as well and it seems like they do stuff too.</p>
<p>We should advertise for speakers/sponsors in some of those groups as we get closer to the beginning of the semester and also confirmation from Rutgers that we will be an actual club. We could just post a simple google doc with "company name" "name" "contact info" "anything else" and like, my email address, but somehow that rubs me the wrong way. I guess I'd rather it be more personal, but at the same time I also want to advertise to the almost 900 people in the NYC IGDA facebook group.</p>
<p>Also Richard had the good (obvious, but the best ideas are the obvious ones) to make a COGS spreadsheet for contacts. Richard had a lot of good ideas. He should really be on the e-board. He's also a pretty good programmer.</p>
<p>Uh, I don't really have anything more I want to write right now but I feel like I should. Oh, he made the point that we should make the COGS demo game by just having a weekend game hackathon; get everyone into a room and make the game. Then probably do some cleanup so that we know how simple it can be. One or two people should do the architecture ahead of time so we just basically have to fill in the parts that we're going to fill in for the livecoding thing.</p>
<p>And we should try out the livecoding idea to see if it actually works before doing it at the first meeting. yes.</p>
