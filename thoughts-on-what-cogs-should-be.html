                    </h2>

                    <p><a href="http://cogs.club/">COGS</a> (domain is new so it might not work yet) is the game development club I co-founded with some people at Rutgers. It used to be an informal seminar run by Lars and some other people based on a former professor's notes from a seminar class. </p>
<p>The problem I was kind of having was that I'm not really sure what COGS should "do". As in, the anime club watches anime, dance troupes practice for performances, USACS organizes the various events for CS majors, but what should COGS do? The first thing that comes to mind is, of course, "make games," when you put it that way.</p>
<p>For the first few meetings, I have talked with other people about doing a sort of live-coding thing with whoever shows up. Basically, we're going to write a simple game over summer break, either a simple platformer or something like pole position. Then we're going to delete all the important parts, like the systems that do movement. (it will be in git so the completed version will be in a separate branch or something). The livecoding sessions will then consist of me (or whoever wants to) standing with a laptop hooked up to a projector, and taking suggestions from the crowd on how to implement the game.</p>
<p>I thought this was a good idea because we can then take suggestions from students who only sort of know Java from CS111 and 112; they don't necessarily need to know how to code their suggestions, as long as they can say something like "make a velocity vector and then add to the position each frame". </p>
<p>Other ideas, i.e. for the rest of the semester, were basically that for the first part of the meeting someone would talk about a concept in game design or development, and then the rest of the meeting would be spent working individually or in groups on whatever people wanted. The problem with that model is that it doesn't really include artists in a meaningful way, or any other part of game development (e.g. design or story).</p>
<p>A common suggestion at the one or two planning meetings we had before the semester ended was for everyone to work on a group project, and I'm starting to think that would be a good idea. In particular, when I realized the answer to "what does COGS do?" should be "make games," it seems fairly obvious. I have a moderately-ambitious game idea that I talked about with one or two other people, which I might write more about.</p>
