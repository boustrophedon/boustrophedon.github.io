My personal blog.

Pelican conf files, plugins, theme, and pipfiles are in `pelican/`. Source markdown posts are in `pelican/posts/`. Run `pelican` in the `pelican/` directory (after `pipenv shell`ing) to generate test files into `pelican/tmp`. Run the `publish.sh` script to generate the files into the root directory, commit, and push.
