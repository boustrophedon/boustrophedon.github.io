&lt;p&gt;So I finally started to work on my multiplayer breakout clone in dart that I've been meaning to do forever. It's moderately functional now. This post is how I am deploying the …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Harry Stern</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:harrystern.net,2015-03-04:/how-im-deploying-dart-server-code-on-digitalocean.html</guid><category>System Administration</category><category>dart</category><category>deployment</category><category>systemd</category><category>fedora</category><category>websockets</category></item><item><title>How to make daily backups with rdiff-backup and systemd</title><link>https://harrystern.net/how-to-make-daily-backups-with-rdiff-backup-and-systemd.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was talking to one of my friends and he mentioned how he lost a hard drive recently and consequently all of his stuff.

It's from 1995 which makes it almost 20 years old, but the fundamental mathematics don't change and it's quite comprehensive. I found it released freely &lt;a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/principles-of-digital-image-synthesis-now-free-for-download/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
