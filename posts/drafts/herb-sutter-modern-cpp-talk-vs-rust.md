1) in the words of one of my friends, herb sutter's talks are all great
2) almost all of the modern c++ style here is essentially how normal rust code is written. it's really amazing just how much the rust designers got right.

if you want to learn how to write good c++, learn how to write rust.

given how much he talks about lifetimes and ownership it's kind of insane that there aren't (or i haven't heard of at least) languages besides rust that have explicit notions of lifetimes and ownership in the language specification. (of course, he is also putting lifetimes in c++)
