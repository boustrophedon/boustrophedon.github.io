                    </h2>

                    <p>I put the last post on the COGS Facebook group and Andrew made some good points, and I talked to V and Billy and they made similar points (those two also gave me other ideas which I will talk about later in this post). Basically, making a game that's big enough to be a group project is difficult to do during the semester for a variety of reasons, moreso if people don't have extrinsic motivation like getting a grade. So I don't think we're going to do a big club-wide game project.</p>
<p>Suggestions that were made for other things to do: still make games, but on a smaller scale. Have mini-hackathons on the weekend where the goal is to make some small game that fits a theme. If the livecoding thing goes well (oh, by the way, I think we're doing to do a 2d tron game.) we can do more of those. I am a bit afraid that I will just end up awkwardly standing there. Hopefully I can get people to participate by seeding the audience with people who helped write the game in the first place.</p>
<p>One thing that we definitely can't do is just gather people in a room and say "okay, now make games." That's not going to work. Anyone who could do that without needing any help probably already is and doesn't need someone to tell them. The people we want to get into the club are people who either don't know how to make games, and people whose CS abilities are good enough but they don't have artists to work with or realize that making games is fun or something. </p>
<p>So we need to have events that focus on teaching people how to make games, and getting people who normally wouldn't consider trying to make games to try and make games. This includes getting artists and possibly musicians involved, and we need to follow up on leads in that direction as well. We have an entire art school; some of the people there must think that making video game art sounds cool.</p>
<p>More importantly: food. We can't use the money Rutgers gives us (however that much ends up being. I would guess maybe $50? We can use it for Unreal Engine/Unity/whatever site licenses), but we can use money we get from outside sources for whatever we want, including getting pizza for talks/meetings. So, V and Billy suggested we use USACS' contact excel sheet and/or cold-email people who have some sort of stake in game development, e.g. Microsoft, and ask them to sponsor us/throw us money. They can send people to come give a talk or whatever. Oh look I just found <a href="http://www.gamedevmap.com/index.php?query=New+York+City">this neat map</a> that has a list of game development companies near NYC. If it's a game studio that actually makes games I don't really care if they give us money if they can send devs or someone down to talk to us, or if they let us come visit their offices or something. (and we could use Rutgers money for bus fare I think) Oh, interesting. I was looking at that list and apparently the <a href="http://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a>, the organization that originally ran the Global Game Jam, is in South Jersey. Oh hey, Rockstar's headquarters <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/careers/openings/rockstar-nyc">is in NYC</a>. </p>
<p>I definitely think if we get devs from some of these companies to come give talks on whatever and if even a few of them give us money, COGS will be on its way to becoming a legitimate-seeming club.</p>

                    </h2>

                    <p><a href="http://cogs.club/">COGS</a> (domain is new so it might not work yet) is the game development club I co-founded with some people at Rutgers. It used to be an informal seminar run by Lars and some other people based on a former professor's notes from a seminar class. </p>
<p>The problem I was kind of having was that I'm not really sure what COGS should "do". As in, the anime club watches anime, dance troupes practice for performances, USACS organizes the various events for CS majors, but what should COGS do? The first thing that comes to mind is, of course, "make games," when you put it that way.</p>
<p>For the first few meetings, I have talked with other people about doing a sort of live-coding thing with whoever shows up. Basically, we're going to write a simple game over summer break, either a simple platformer or something like pole position. Then we're going to delete all the important parts, like the systems that do movement. (it will be in git so the completed version will be in a separate branch or something). The livecoding sessions will then consist of me (or whoever wants to) standing with a laptop hooked up to a projector, and taking suggestions from the crowd on how to implement the game.</p>
<p>I thought this was a good idea because we can then take suggestions from students who only sort of know Java from CS111 and 112; they don't necessarily need to know how to code their suggestions, as long as they can say something like "make a velocity vector and then add to the position each frame". </p>
<p>Other ideas, i.e. for the rest of the semester, were basically that for the first part of the meeting someone would talk about a concept in game design or development, and then the rest of the meeting would be spent working individually or in groups on whatever people wanted. The problem with that model is that it doesn't really include artists in a meaningful way, or any other part of game development (e.g. design or story).</p>
<p>A common suggestion at the one or two planning meetings we had before the semester ended was for everyone to work on a group project, and I'm starting to think that would be a good idea. In particular, when I realized the answer to "what does COGS do?" should be "make games," it seems fairly obvious. I have a moderately-ambitious game idea that I talked about with one or two other people, which I might write more about.</p>
