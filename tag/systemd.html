                        <p>So I finally started to work on my multiplayer breakout clone in dart that I've been meaning to do forever. It's moderately functional now. This post is how I am deploying the server code on digitalocean. It's written mostly for someone who has maybe used a desktop linux environment and isn't completely lost on the command line, but who maybe hasn't set up a server before. Here is the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new fedora droplet<ul>
<li>ssh keys</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>yum update (optional)</li>
<li>create new user</li>
<li>copy ssh keys to new user's directory<ul>
<li>make sure permissions are correct</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>add user to wheel</li>
<li>remove root login from sshd_config</li>
<li>add dartapps user<ul>
<li>useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin dartapps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>download and unzip dart-sdk to /opt/</li>
<li>symlink /opt/dart-sdk/bin/{dart,dart2js,pub} to /usr/bin/{dart,dart2js,pub}</li>
<li>cd to /usr/local/bin and git clone the repo</li>
<li>This is what I did originally to get deps working:<ul>
<li>if not running as root, switch to root</li>
<li>run <code>PUB_CACHE=/usr/local/bin/dart-breakout/pub-cache pub get</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also choose to do the previous step and the following on the server, or locally and scp the file:<ul>
<li>after getting the dependencies with pub get, create a build/ directory and run:
    <code>dart2js --categories=Server --output-type=dart bin/server.dart -o build/server.dart</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>create systemd unit file<ul>
<li>if building with dart2js, set the exec file accordingly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>enable unit file</li>
<li>start unit file</li>
<li>yay</li>
</ul>
<p>First, create a digitalocean droplet running Fedora (21 is the latest they have as of 3/15). You should probably choose to have your ssh key included.</p>
<p>The next step is optional: Do a <code>yum update</code>. This, of course, updates all of your packages and may take a little while. It will also most likely give you some security fixes that you probably want.</p>
<p>Next we're going to create a new user so that you're not running as root all the time, because that is a bad idea. run <code>useradd NEWUSERNAME</code> with whatever you want, and follow the directions. Add this user to wheel with <code>usermod -a -G wheel NEWUSERNAME</code>, which will give it access to sudo. You can modify your /etc/sudoers (with <code>visudo</code> !) so that you don't have to type your password for sudo, or not, depending on your preference. Finally, if you added ssh keys on droplet creation, copy them from .ssh/authorized_keys to /home/NEWUSERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys and make sure to chown and chgrp your new /home/NEWUSERNAME/.ssh/ directory so it's owned by your new user.</p>
<p>Since digitalocean provides console access via its web dashboard, there's really no reason to allow root logins from ssh, so now that we have a new user that we can log in to (check to make sure you can log in first; you may have to reboot the server) let's fix that. Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config as root and uncomment the line <code>PermitRootLogin yes</code>, and change yes to no. Try sshing to the droplet as root. If it still works, you need to restart the ssh server or at least reload the configs.</p>
<p>Now we're going to create a user to run our dart server. We want it to have very few privileges on the system in case someone takes advantage of a vulnerability in the server and is able to execute arbitrary code, and it is also convenient for other purposes, like bandwidth-limiting, disk space quotas, other monitoring stuff that I'm not going to cover. I'm going to call this user 'dartapps' but you can call it whatever. To create it, run <code>useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin dartapps</code>. The -r option makes the user a system user, without a home directory, and -s /sbin/nologin means that it doesn't have a login shell; you cannot login as this user even if you gave it a password.</p>
<p>It is now time to install the dart sdk. Open https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html#other and copy the 64-bit linux download url. Download it into /opt and unzip it (you will probably need to <code>yum install unzip</code>). In order to make things convenient, you can symlink any or all of the files in /opt/dart-sdk/bin/ to /usr/bin/ by doing <code>ln -s /opt/dart-sdk/bin/dart /usr/bin/dart</code>, and similarly for the others. At the very least you will want to do this for the dart and pub commands. You may also need to <code>chmod o+rx /opt/dart-sdk/bin/dart</code> if you cannot run e.g. <code>dart --help</code> from your NEWUSERNAME user.</p>
<p>At this point we finally get to download our own code. Either scp your server code, git clone it, or whatever, into some directory. I chose /usr/local/bin/dart-breakout/ for my breakout code, but it could just have easily gone into /srv/ or something. /srv may in fact be a better choice.</p>
<p>There is an optional, somewhat unsupported step here: Instead of copying all your code over, you may, on your local development machine, create a build/bin directory in your pub package file structure. Then, run the following command, assuming your server dart code is in bin/server.dart: <code>dart2js --categories=Server --output-type=dart bin/server.dart -o build/bin/server.dart</code>. This runs "dart2dart" on your code and puts it all in a single file, but instead of outputting js it outputs dart code. You may also do this on the server after getting the dependencies as explained in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>If you did not follow the above optional step, this is what I originally did: Normally, pub downloads your packages into ~/.pub-cache. However, our dartapps user does not have a home directory. If we try to run <code>pub get</code> as root, pub will install our dependencies into /root/.pub-cache, which is of course unreadable by the dartapps user. We can fix this by either creating a global pub-cache inside, say, /usr/local/include/ or /usr/local/lib/, but I chose the option of creating it inside my server's code directory, so /usr/local/bin/dart-breakout/pub-cache. This is already a bit messy and a mild abuse of /usr/local/bin, and the better option is to compile all your dart code to a single file as in the above step.</p>
<p>In order to create this extra pub cache directory, we need to (as root), run <code>PUB_CACHE=/usr/local/bin/dart-breakout/pub-cache pub get</code>. Setting the PUB_CACHE variable tells pub where to put the cache, and sets up the symlinks to point at that local cache for our application. Of course, be sure to substitute dart-breakout for your own name. You should test that the dependencies are installed and permissions are correct by running the server as a non-root user.</p>
<p>Lastly, we get monitoring, logging, and restart-on-crash for free by creating a simple systemd unit file that runs our server as the dartapps user. Drop this file into /etc/systemd/system/dart-breakout.service, replacing dart-breakout in both the filename and inside the file as needed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">[Service]</span>
<span class="na">ExecStart</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">/usr/bin/dart /usr/local/bin/dart-breakout/bin/server.dart</span>
<span class="na">Restart</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">always</span>
<span class="na">StandardOutput</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">syslog</span>
<span class="na">StandardError</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">syslog</span>
<span class="na">SyslogIdentifier</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">dart-breakout</span>
<span class="na">User</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">dartapps</span>
<span class="na">Group</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">dartapps</span>

<span class="k">[Install]</span>
<span class="na">WantedBy</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">multi-user.target</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you followed the optional "dart2dart" step, replace the project/bin/server.dart file with the compiled file, which you would probably install to /usr/local/bin/ directly.</p>
<p>And now we're done! Run (as root) <code>systemctl enable dart-breakout</code> to enable the service to run on startup, and <code>systemctl start dart-breakout</code> to start the server now. You can use <code>journalctl -u dart-breakout</code> to view the output of your program.</p>
